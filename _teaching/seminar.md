**Role:** Course Developer and Instructor

This seminar examines how different types of political threats shape attitudes and behaviors. The course uses a unique "working backwards" methodology, beginning with current meta-analyses and tracing intellectual development back to seminal works.

**Innovative Pedagogical Approach:**
* **"Working Backwards" Methodology:** Start with current research synthesis and trace development to foundational works
* **Systematic Coverage:** Examine terrorism, civil wars, interstate conflicts, and spillover effects
* **Multi-outcome Focus:** Analyze voting behavior, defense spending, tolerance, and policy preferences
* **Critical Engagement:** Students evaluate theoretical critiques and identify future research directions

**Course Structure:**
1. **Current Knowledge:** Begin with meta-analyses and review articles
2. **Intellectual History:** Trace development of key theories and findings
3. **Methodological Evolution:** Examine how research methods have advanced
4. **Future Directions:** Identify gaps and emerging research questions

**Student Learning Outcomes:**
* Understand how knowledge evolves in political science
* Develop skills in systematic literature evaluation
* Practice identifying research gaps and opportunities
* Integrate theoretical and methodological knowledge

This course directly integrates with my research program, allowing students to engage with cutting-edge research while developing critical analytical skills essential for academic and professional success.
