**Abstract**

Meta-analyses are used to synthesize a body of literature to produce a single summary estimate as well as to explain differences among studies. The field of political science has slowly gained an appreciation for their use in recent years; however, using meta-analyses in dissertations remains rare. This is puzzling, given the tool's ability to map a topic, to highlight potential gaps for future research to address, and its long-lasting utility for researchers in future projects. We argue that for these and several other reasons, graduate students should consider including a meta-analysis in their dissertation. This article discusses these advantages in detail and offers advice on how to conduct a meta-analysis based on several interviews and applied examples. We also address potential challenges when using this research design in a dissertation.

**Key Findings:**
Our analysis of 249 APSA dissertations from 2020 found that only one incorporated a quantitative meta-analysis, and only 32 dissertations even cited meta-analyses. This represents a significant gap between meta-analyses used in the literature and those in dissertations, despite growing references to meta-analyses in top political science journals.

**Six Main Advantages for Graduate Students:**
1. **Comprehensive literature collection:** Systematically collect all existing research on dissertation topic
2. **Professional networking:** Expand professional network through extensive outreach to scholars
3. **Standalone dissertation chapter:** Serves as baseline establishing what is known and unknown
4. **High citation potential:** Meta-analyses tend to be cited frequently and demonstrate expertise
5. **Long-term utility:** Creates searchable dataset useful for future research projects
6. **Publication bias analysis:** Helps discipline understand extent of biases in research

**Methodological Contribution:**
The paper addresses a significant gap in political science training by showing how meta-analysis can be used not just for literature reviews but as a primary research method for testing theoretical claims across multiple contexts. This approach has been adopted by several graduate programs and influences how students approach comprehensive literature reviews.
