**Abstract**

Generative artificial intelligence has changed the classroom experience, for better and worse. We contend that instructors can leverage GAI to assist them in quickly creating and implementing classroom-based simulation activities and demonstrations. We use applied political science teaching examples ranging from theory to methodology to help demonstrate our point that GAI can greatly decrease the time and programming costs of creating good classroom learning tools.

**Key Contributions:**
- Demonstrates how GAI can overcome barriers of time constraints and programming expertise
- Provides concrete examples across political science subfields (methodology, theory, American politics, international relations)
- Shows how instructors can create sophisticated interactive simulations without extensive coding knowledge
- Addresses concerns about AI in education while highlighting productive pedagogical applications

**Practical Applications:**
Despite trepidation about plagiarism and academic dishonesty, this research shows how classroom-based demonstrations and simulations can greatly benefit from GAI assistance. We demonstrate that instructors can leave the heavy lifting (in regards to coding) to GAI, so they can focus on their classroom content and pedagogical goals.

**Innovation in Political Science Education:**
The paper illustrates how GAI enables instructors to be more dynamic and responsive in their teaching, create accessible learning tools that work across different devices and platforms, and democratize the use of sophisticated simulations in political science classrooms.
