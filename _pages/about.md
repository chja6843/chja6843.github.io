I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research examines how individuals and societies respond to political violence and security threats, with particular focus on emotional responses to terrorism and conflict spillover effects.

My dissertation, "Emotional Responses to Terrorism: Understanding Public Reactions to Violent Political Threats," investigates the psychological mechanisms through which exposure to political violence shapes public opinion and policy preferences.

## Current Research

- **Emotional responses to terrorism:** Using experimental methods to understand how fear, anger, and empathy shape policy preferences
- **Conflict spillover effects:** Examining how civil wars influence political attitudes in neighboring countries
- **Methodological and pedagogy:** Meta-analytic approaches and AI integration in political science education
