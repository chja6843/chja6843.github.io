My teaching philosophy centers on helping students to become active consumers and creators of knowledge. I focus on developing critical thinking abilities and preparing students for success across different career paths through innovative pedagogical approaches.

## Teaching Innovation

Together with Dr. Andrew Q. Philips, I have worked to include artificial intelligence in political science education. Our research published in the Journal of Political Science Education, "Using AI to DIY? Incorporating AI-Generated Learning Tools in the Classroom," demonstrates how AI can help instructors make dynamic, visually-appealing, and unique classroom simulations.

## Teaching Philosophy

Beyond anything else, I want students to leave my classes having learned how to critically engage with information they encounter in the world. Rather than simply transmitting information, I focus on teaching students how to think critically about the political world around them, how to identify reliable sources, and how to construct well-reasoned arguments.
