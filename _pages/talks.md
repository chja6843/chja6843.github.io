I've presented across political science conferences including the Peace Science Society, Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA), International Studies Association (ISA), and Peace Science Society. These presentations showcase ongoing research on responses to political violence, conflict spillover effects, and methodological innovations.

## Recent Highlights

Invited Talk (2025): "Synthesize This: Meta-Analysis as a Dissertation Tool" at McMaster University's Spark Talk series, discussing practical applications of meta-analytic methods for dissertation research.

Major Conference Presentations: Research presented at Peace Science 2024 (Ann Arbor), featuring collaborative work on religious threat messaging in India, and MPSA 2024 (Chicago), presenting methodological research on dynamic heterogeneity in international relations.
