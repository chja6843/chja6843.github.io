<p>My teaching philosophy centers on helping students to become active consumers and creators of knowledge. I focus on developing critical thinking abilities and preparing students for success across different career paths through innovative pedagogical approaches.</p>

<h2>Teaching Innovation</h2>

<p>Together with Dr. Andrew Q. Philips, I have worked to include artificial intelligence in political science education. Our research published in the <em>Journal of Political Science Education</em>, "Using AI to DIY? Incorporating AI-Generated Learning Tools in the Classroom," demonstrates how AI can help instructors make dynamic, visually-appealing, and unique classroom simulations.</p>

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>Beyond anything else, I want students to leave my classes having learned how to critically engage with information they encounter in the world. Rather than simply transmitting information, I focus on teaching students how to think critically about the political world around them, how to identify reliable sources, and how to construct well-reasoned arguments.</p>
