**Solo-authored research** examining how proximity to civil conflicts shapes citizen preferences for military expenditure. Using spatial analysis and individual-level survey data, this research challenges existing work by examining micro-level responses to regional conflicts.

**Key Findings:**
* Citizens living closer to active civil wars express higher preferences for defense spending
* Effect strongest for conflicts with high civilian targeting
* Individual-level mechanisms complement state-level conflict spillover theories

**Research Significance:** Demonstrates how conflicts create region-wide security dilemmas through domestic political processes, with implications for arms races and regional stability.
