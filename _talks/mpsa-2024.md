**Authors:** Christopher Jackson and Andrew Q. Philips

This methods paper addresses important issues in international relations research related to unobserved heterogeneity in dynamic models. We demonstrate how failing to account for unobserved dynamic heterogeneity can lead to biased results and provide practical solutions for researchers.

**Methodological Contributions:**
* Identification of common modeling problems in IR research
* Practical solutions for dynamic heterogeneity
* Applications to conflict and international cooperation research

Currently under review at *International Interactions*.
