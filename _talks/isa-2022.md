**Authors:** Marc Polizzi and Christopher Jackson

Examines how resource extraction conflicts in Peru are influenced by the mining canon system, which redistributes mining revenues to local communities. We analyze whether revenue-sharing mechanisms can reduce conflict over resource extraction.

**Research Questions:**
* How does revenue redistribution affect local conflict over mining?
* What institutional mechanisms best manage resource extraction tensions?
* Implications for conflict prevention in resource-rich regions
